# MultiSigBTC

## About the project
MultiSigBTC is a project that is created in the context of the subject “Decentralized Technologies”, that take place in the master’s degree program "Data and Web Science" of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
It is developed from scratch by Kalyvas Emmanouil using the python library [bitcoin-utils](https://github.com/karask/python-bitcoin-utils) developed by Kostas Karasavvas.

## What does MultiSigBTC do?
MultiSigBTC is a tool that can be used to create and maintain multi signature addresses that can be used to send and receive funds in the Bitcoin blockchain. A multi signature address, is an address that have m owners and requires n of them to agree upon a transaction. MultiSigBTC can theoretically create multi signature addresses with any m and n combination.
**Please note that this a an experimental tool that was not tested thoroughly (at least not yet) and it is not recommended using it on mainnet.**

## How to use?

### Command : create_new_address

    MultiSigBTC.py create_new_address [-h] [-s SEED] keyName password

#### Description:
Create a new private-public key pair along with its legacy bitcoin address
#### Positional arguments:
||Description|
|--|--|
|**keyName**|The name of the key (can be anything, avoid create multiple keys with the same name)|

| -s SEED, --seed SEED | The seed used for the random generator (a specific seed produces the same address)|


### Command : create_multisig_address

    MultiSigBTC.py create_multisig_address [-h] signaturesRequired keyfile [keyfile ...]

### Description : 
Create a multi signature address given the public keys you want to be involved

#### Positional arguments:
||Description|
|--|--|
|**signaturesRequired**|Number of required signatures to unlock UTXO|
|**keyfile**| The file containing the key to be used for the multi signature address funds (can be created with the command create_new_address -o path). You can also privide the JSON result of create_new_address or name and public key pairs or any combination of the expected input formats.

### Command : create_multisig_transaction

    MultiSigBTC.py create_multisig_transaction [-h] address amount fee multisigKeyFile
#### Description:
Create an unsigned multisignature transaction (Note: it needs to be signed by
the owners with the command sign_transaction)

#### Positional arguments:
||Description|
|--|--|
|address          |Address to send the transaction to|
|amount           |Amount to spend|
|fee              |Fee amount to pay|
|multisigKeyFile  |The file containing the multi signature keys (can be created with create_multisig_address -o path). You can also provide the json result of create_multisig_address in place of multisigKeyFile|

#### Optional arguments:
||Description|
|--|--|
| -h, --help|show help and exit|


### Command : sign_multisig_transaction

    MultiSigBTC.py sign_multisig_transaction [-h] transactionFile addressFile password
    
#### Description :
Add a signature to a multisig transaction. Use to sign a transaction created
with create_multisig_transaction. Please note that every time someone signs
the transaction, the next person needs to sign the transaction using the
previous result in order to maintain all the signatures

#### Positional arguments:
||Description|
|--|--|
|  transactionFile  |The file containing the details for the unsigned or partially signed transaction (can be created with create_multisig_transaction -o path). You can also provide the json result of create_multisig_transaction in place of transactionFile|
|addressFile      |The file containing the encrypted private key (can becreated with create_new_address -o path) or the private key itself. If you provide the private key itself, you must give the key name in place of password. This is important  for the order of the keys. The name of the key is defined durting the multisig address creation|
|  password         |The password to decrypt the private key or if you gave the private key itself you need to set the name of the key as defined during the multisig address generation|

#### Optional arguments:
||Description|
|--|--|
|  -h, --help       |show help and exit|


### Command : get_private_key
    MultiSigBTC.py get_private_key [-h] keyFile password
